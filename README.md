# golang_http_upload_with_progressbar

a web interface with progress bar uploading, and golang is backend, very simple version.

we need a web interface for the browsers to upload large videos files between computers in our local network, 

for local network file share is painful with unstable windows authentications.

So two useful techniques :

1 upload with progress bar and retrieve file name from server side.

2 upload system with nodejs, Multer and Express which can be setup in minutes

the original codes are from different websites on the internet, and we modified the codes and made some provement. 

start the server with command:
			

	go run go.go 


The server should be loaded at https://locahost:6688/ and then try https://locahost:6688/ with progress bar.

We are going series of HTTP upload simple systems via different kinds of programming languages. We've done with node js, and golang.
Enjoy
